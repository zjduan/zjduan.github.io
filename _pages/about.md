I am Zhijian Duan (段志健), a Ph.D. candidate in Peking University supervised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree from [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm) in School of EECS, Peking University. I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Ming Zhang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/dlib/mzhang/) and Prof. [Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io/) in Peking University, and Prof. [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) in Mila.

My research interests are algorithmic game theory and machine learning, along with their applications on Internet economics.
