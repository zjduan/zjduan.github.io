Hello, I am Zhijian Duan (段志健), a Ph.D. student in [CFCS](cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/) at Peking University, where I am supervised by Professor [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm) in [daGAME](https://dagame.pku.edu.cn/) lab. 
Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm) in the School of EECS at Peking University. 
During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with Professor [Ming Zhang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/dlib/mzhang/) and Professor [Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io/) at Peking University, as well as Professor [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/).

My research focuses on machine learning-aided algorithmic game theory, which includes mechanism design, equilibrium computation, and decision making, as well as their applications in advertisement and recommendation. For more information, please refer to my publication list.
