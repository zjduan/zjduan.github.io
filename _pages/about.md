Hello, I am Zhijian Duan (段志健), a Ph.D. student in [CFCS](cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/) at Peking University, where I am supervised by Professor [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm) in [daGAME](https://dagame.pku.edu.cn/) lab. 
Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm) in the School of EECS at Peking University. 
During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with Professor [Ming Zhang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/dlib/mzhang/) and Professor [Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io/) at Peking University, as well as Professor [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/).

### Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of algorithmic game theory and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on the following topics:
* Machine learning-based mechanism design.
* Equilibrium computation leveraging machine learning techniques.
* Online advertising, including ad auction design and auto-bidding.
  
For more information, please refer to my publication list.
